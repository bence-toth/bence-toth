Front-end developer, software architect, tech lead, mentor, teacher, tutor, volunteer, open source advocate, functional programming enthusiast, a11y nerd, CSS ninja.

Currently working as a Team Lead at @Zendesk.

I build software and relationships.

I believe that whatever you do, empathy and compassion will go a long way. Be a decent human, and everything else will fall in place.

I might not be wrong about everything I say.
