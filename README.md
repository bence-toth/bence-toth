I’m an engineering manager, a front-end developer at heart, with a drive for building not just software, but also strong, inclusive teams and lasting relationships. As a software architect, mentor, and educator, I thrive on creating systems and environments where both people and technology can flourish. I’m deeply invested in operational excellence, accessibility, internationalization, and the principles of functional programming — and I’ve been known to get quite nerdy about CSS, too.

I’m committed to fostering equity, belonging, and understanding in the tech community and beyond. Whether acting and advocating for inclusion or meaningfully contributing to corporate social responsibility initiatives, I believe that change happens through consistent action and authentic conversations. It’s about listening actively, learning always, and supporting and empowering each other relentlessly, and in tangible ways.

When I’m not at the keyboard, I’m exploring the world of music production, diving into the intricacies of language and etymology, or immersing myself in the science and the history of discovery. These interests feed my curiosity and remind me that creativity and discovery are connecting us all across cultures and times.

Whatever I do, I lead with empathy and curiosity. It’s the best way to solve problems, build relationships, and leave things better than I found them.

I’m currently working as an Engineering Manager at [Zendesk](https://github.com/zendesk), and volunteering at [HackYourFuture](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH), [Impact Roasters](https://github.com/impact-roasters), [CodeForward](https://github.com/code-forward-dk), and more.
