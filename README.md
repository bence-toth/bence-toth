Engineering manager. Front-end developer at heart. Software architect, tech lead, educator, mentor, volunteer, open source advocate, functional programming enthusiast, a11y and i18n nerd, CSS ninja, wannabe viking.

I build software and relationships. I have a knack for people and getting things done.

I believe that whatever you do, empathy and compassion will go a long way. Be a decent human, and everything else will fall in place.

I might not be wrong about everything I say.

Currently working as an Engineering Manager at [Zendesk](https://github.com/zendesk), and volunteering at [HackYourFuture](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH), [Impact Roasters](https://github.com/impact-roasters), [CodeForward](https://github.com/code-forward-dk), and more.
